2. About the Phantasy Star IV Randomizer

The PS2 Randomizer was designed to change the around so that it would feel like a fresh experience every time you played this Genesis classic.

Pick your options, choose your save path and file name (you can leave the file extention blank, as this will be filled in later). When you press "Randomize Rom", select your ORIGINAL rom file (don't worry, it will remain unchanged) and then a new, randomized rom will be created at your selected path and with your file name, along with the seed and flags.

3. Features and Options
By mousing over each option, you can see a brief tool-tip about what the option does and any issues or notes with the option.

Treasure Changes:
You may choose to either Shuffle the vanilla chest list or Randomize it entirely. Chests may contain money or items and are not exclusive to what their original chest contained. Which ever way you choose, there is a slight process that is followed.

-Dynamite is first randomized into a chest in Shure. This is to ensure you can get into Nido.
-A 2nd Dynamite is randomized into a chest in Shure or Nido. This is to ensure you can get into Biosystems Lab.
-The last Dynamite is randomized in a chest in Shure, Nido, or the top three floors of Biosystems Lab. This will ensure you can get to the Recorder.
-The Prism is randomized into any chest except those in Climatrol, the Dezo Temples, or the 2nd chest of Esper Mansion.
-The Nei Items are randomized into any remaining chest except for those in Climatrol or the 2nd chest of Esper Mansion.
-Remaining chests are shuffled or randomized.

Items that are obtained by plot means (Small Key, Letter, Teim, Recorder, Key Tube, Mareura Leaf, Red/Yellow/Blue/Green Cards) can STILL be obtained by normal means. When Randomized, any of those key items can be in any chest and there can be more than one. They can also show up in Climatrol.

ALSO: You will probably not want to give any key item to Nei before fighting Neifirst. Once Nei is gone, any items she has are also gone and that WILL create a softlock. 

Walk-Speed Increase:
This is an option that will increase the walking speed in game to be on-par (or even faster) than that of Phantasy Star IV. Definitely a much-needed update to this old game.

4. Known Issues

Checksum issues:
It shouldn't happen with the Checksum removal, but if for any reason when you go to load the rom, it gives you a Red Screen, just enable the AutoFix Checksum option on your emulator (Gens and Kega both have it). It should fix the problem.

Teim Glitch:
This is known within the speedrunning community, but if you have an extra Teim and enter the North Bridge from the left side, you will immediately exit the bridge and the Y value of the map's collision detection moves down a tile. You also will not get into encounters until you enter an area again. It isn't game-breaking, but it is still there.

Item Dupe, Inventory Glitch, etc:
All of those tricks are still in the game. 

Invalid Rom:
There are a couple of different roms floating around and some will read as invalid. The randomizer will work for the US v1.0 of Phantasy Star II. Also, there are a couple of different files of this floating around as well. The correct file size that will work with this randomizer is 768,432 bytes. 

5. Future Features and Ideas

-I would like to find a way to increase battle speed
-Increases to Monster XP and Meseta drops
-Randomization of character stats and techniques (maybe even give Rudo some techs)
-Balancing/fixing of equipment (such as the Laconia Dagger's attack power)
-I would like to find a way to skip text or auto-advance the text in game.
-Randomization of Monster stats
-Shop Inventory and Price randomization

6. Thanks

Thanks and shoutouts to the Phantasy Star speedrunning community for inspiring me to work on this randomizer and those who have offered to test the program out.

Big thanks to Lory_90 for contributing all ton of information with his disassemblies, checksum removal, and walk-speed increasing. This randomizer would not be possible without him.

Huge thanks to Serria for putting up with me working on this Randomizer.
